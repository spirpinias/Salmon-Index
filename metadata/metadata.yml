name: Salmon Preparing Transcriptome Indices for Mapping-Based Mode
description: |-
  Salmon is a tool for wicked-fast transcript quantification from RNA-seq data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or de-novo assembly) to quantify. This capsule generates an index of transcripts for use downstream in salmon quantification for raw fastq files.
